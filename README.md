Introduction/Proposal 
A fast-pace fps easy to play on all platforms. 
We chose to make this because we play lots of fps and a love the games.

Method 
We developed our project by untiy code and other assests we got for free.
we used software on the laptop.
The challenges we faced were extremely hard. The multiplayer took longer than it was supposed to. Zombies was complicated because they dont listen.
The new Assets we downloaded couldnt work becuase of the type of laptops we got.
Our wiki is based on our progress so far.
